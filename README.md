<h1>osTicket - Ticket Lifecycle: Intake Through Resolution</h1>
This project involves setting up and managing the lifecycle of a support ticket using osTicket, an open-source ticketing system. The lifecycle covers all stages from ticket creation by a user, through processing and troubleshooting by support agents, to final resolution and closure.

## Use Case
- **Customer Support**: Ideal for businesses needing an organized method to handle customer inquiries and issues.
- **IT Help Desk**: Suitable for IT departments to manage internal support tickets and service requests.
- **Other Organizations**: Can be used in different organization environments to track and respond to volunteer or service requests efficiently.

## Challenges
- **Customization**: Tailoring osTicket to fit specific workflow requirements can be complex.
- **Maintenance**: Requires regular updates and maintenance to keep the system secure and functional on top of nuanced installation configurations.
